2. interval_start IS NOT INITIALIZED CORRECTLY
Line 30
interval_start = dates_list[1] should be interval_start = dates_list[0] 
# Start with the first element a = 50


3. INCORRECT TOLL-FREE DATE CODE
Line 49/50: The code returns 1 as the toll fee for toll-free dates, but it should return 0
if TollCalculator.is_toll_free_date(date):
return 1
should be 
if TollCalculator.is_toll_free_date(date): 
return 0


4. LABELLING ERROR
Line 82-86
In the is_toll_free_date method, using values like  val and anotherval  makes it more complicated, use instead  constants like date.weekday() and date.month. 
Replace val == 7 with a == 5 and anotherval == 6 with b == 7.
        
    

5. CONDITIONAL STATEMENT CONTEXT ERROR
Line 67
There is an incorrect use of â€œorâ€œ in the conditional statement
